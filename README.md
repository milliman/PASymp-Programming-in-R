# PASymp-Programming-in-R

**For Educational Purposes Only**

Within this repository, the reader will find R code to accompany Ben Johnson's demonstration on beginning programming
in R that was presented at the SOA Predictive Analytics Symposium in Chicago on 9/14/2017. The objective of this demonstration 
is to fit a logistic regression model to predict whether a movie will gross more than its budget. 

To run the code from the several included R scripts, refer to the SourceScripts file for the order that the scripts should be ran. 
Although the scripts do have annotations throughout, please refer to the MarkdownDemo file in order to read through this code with
more detailed descriptions.
